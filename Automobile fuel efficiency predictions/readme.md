This repository is a reflection of the final web deployment of ML models using Flask and cloud service Heroku. The models deployed are - Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines.

Currently, I have followed the steps of the tutorial for EDA, data preparation and working with models from the YouTube link provided below. I am working on the front-end development of pushing the best-selected model to production using Flask and Heroku/NetLify/Streamlit. I will keep updating this repo as soon as progress is made on the project.

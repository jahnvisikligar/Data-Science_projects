# Maximizing Sales with Customer Segmentation using EDA, RFM, and Case Study Analysis   

I worked on a project to analyze sales data in order to better understand the target market. The project was divided into four parts: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Sales per country, Case study on the UK, and Customer Segmentation using RFM.

The first step was to perform EDA on the dataset, which included examining the shape and columns, checking for null and duplicate values, and calculating correlations between columns. I then visualized the data to better understand sales per country and identified the United Kingdom as having the highest sales and product quantity.

Next, I conducted a case study on the UK region, as it may be a future target market. Using the Apriori Algorithm, I analyzed the structured relationships between different itemsets in the region and found that British customers tend to purchase different colored tea-plates together.

Finally, I used RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to implement Customer Segmentation, which analyzed the current status of customers and segmented them based on their scores. I calculated recency as the last subscription date, frequency as the number of orders, and monetary as the total cost of customer expenses. One segment, for example, had 42 people, whose last purchase was nearly 33 days ago, had a shopping frequency of one, and spent around $165.9 in total.
